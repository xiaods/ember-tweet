Ember Tweet example revisited
=============================

I rewrote the Ember.js example given by Andy Matthews [here](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/flame-on-a-beginners-guide-to-emberjs.html) 
to work with the latest ember.js version (1.0.pre) and follow a better code organization. 

Don't hesitate to provide any feedback or pull requests.
